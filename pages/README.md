# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and create the router of your application.

*Note:*
- *Make sure to include a h1 with the seo-title class and having the page title as content in order to implement SEO.*
- *Make sure to include a head method that sets the meta as hid and a title, once again for SEO purposes.*

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
