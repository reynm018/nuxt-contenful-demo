# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

*Note:*
- *Try to keep this folder as organized as possible. The miscellaneous components should be put in utils folder, and the components used in certain pages should be organized in folders attached to these pages.*

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
