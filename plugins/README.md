# PLUGINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Javascript plugins that you want to run before mounting the root Vue.js application.

*Note:*
- *The vue init js file will trigger actions as the nuxt instance is done building*
- *The vue mixins file should import the mixins to be used globally by the application*
- *The vue plugins file should import the vue plugins*

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins).
