# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

*Note:*
- *The SASS files should be put in the sass mixins. Know that these files are already imported by nuxt, there is no need to import them again to acces the variables and mixins in the components.*
- *Furthermore, images should be put in this folder so that they are compiled by webpack, but don't include videos as it would overuse the server the application is in.*

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).
