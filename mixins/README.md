# MIXINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application mixins.
The mixin lets you define custom javascript object to be merged with the components that import it.

*Note:*
- *If you ever catch yourself writing code twice in separate components, this is usually a good indicator that you need a mixin.*

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html).
